Rather than log everything here, I'll give a high-level overview of my process:

- Opened the project in Cursor and asked it to review the Readme and complete the first task.
- Reviewed the code and improved upon it (with some AI assistance and some manual work).
- Looped in ChatGPT for a second opinion on the hashing algorithm.
- Repeated the process above for the other 3 tasks.
- Asked Cursor to review the Readme again and make sure the code followed the specifications. Made some improvements.
- Asked Cursor for a list of possible improvements, and made one final change.
