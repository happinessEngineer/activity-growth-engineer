In addition to reading the article, I ran a Deep Research task in ChatGPT with instructions to find results of any other experiments that companies have run on in-app purchases vs web paywalls (with a reference to the given [article](https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/growth/iap-vs-web-purchases-conversion-test/)).

**TLDR: Running an A/B test on web vs in-app purchases could be valuable assuming Memorang is on the 30% commission tier.**

(If on the 15% tier, it would be much tougher to reach any substantial revenue gain due to the inevitably lower conversion rate of web-based purchases.)

Some things to consider:
- What kind of revenue boost might we see?
	- Considering that many of Memorang's users are studying for high-stakes tests, indicating higher intent, we might expect a low drop-off for web-based payments.
	- We might also offer a free month extension for any packs purchased via web, to further decrease that drop-off percentage (without decreasing revenue).
	- Examples:
		- A 10% web drop-off = ~24% increase in revenue per purchase*
		- A 20% web drop-off = ~10% increase in revenue per purchase*
		- Note: a 10% web drop-off is about the lowest we might expect based on my research
		- *Includes Stripe fees for web-based purchases.
- Is the potential for increased revenue worth the tradeoffs? 
	- Fewer paid users, more payment-related support requests, a less friendly user experience, etc.
- How long would the experiment need to run?
	- How many users would it take to reach statsig, and how long would that take?
- Should we consider LTV in this experiment?
	- Or is it enough to track one-time conversions? 

Based on the above, I'd say that running a test like this for Memorang is definitely worth further discussion!
